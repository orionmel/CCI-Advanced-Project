## Abstract:
The Disciplined Mushroom is a visual interactive installation, which using Arduino, machine learning, unity AR and other technologies, I combined the image of mushrooms often in my own eating disorder experience and the anti-binary meaning of the mushroom itself, and used the mushroom woman to present the entanglement of food and body of women due to eating disorders. <br>

The whole work is a self- portraiture interactive art installation is based on my own experience of eating disorders and reference to related body anxiety artworks, and I hope this artwork could trigger the discussion of the disciplined women by the patriarchal gaze behind eating disorders, and convey the appeal of "body naturalness" from the standpoint of ecofeminism.

## Technology desciption:
Mainly using unity AR technology, participants can scan the mushroom product label and view machine learning video and medical device 3D models, and using distance detection sensor and light sensor to switch two scene videos.
