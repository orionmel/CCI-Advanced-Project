### The story of my game :
Because of the massive accumulation of pollution and domestic waste, the earth is no longer suitable for human survival. Humans all over the world have disappeared, the once glorious cities have become dilapidated, and only a few human-made robots are left to survive in the world left by humans.<br>
<br>
My name is Rebby, I had a dream one day. someone told me in the dream that I would be trapped in this dream because of a gem, I need to collect a lot of gold coins in exchange for this gem to light up again, in order to get back to the original world, so I started my adventure. . .

### The end of story :

## The popup exhibition :

## The future of my work : 
Because someone gave me a suggestion to add a storyline interface to the game during the exhibition, I thought it was a good suggestion to improve the user experience, because of the time, I didn't add the video's story interface and the final ending to the game, I will consider this part in the process of game iteration.<br> 
<br> 
Besides, for the repeating respawning part of the character, I think the whole game process is not relatively smooth, which is also part of the need for improvement.
