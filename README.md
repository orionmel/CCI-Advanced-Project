## Abstract:
The Disciplined Mushroom is a visual interactive installation, which using Arduino, machine learning, unity AR and other technologies, I combined the image of mushrooms often in my own eating disorder experience and the anti-binary meaning of the mushroom itself, and used the mushroom woman to present the entanglement of food and body of women due to eating disorders. <br>

The whole work is a self- portraiture interactive art installation is based on my own experience of eating disorders and reference to related body anxiety artworks, and I hope this artwork could trigger the discussion of the disciplined women by the patriarchal gaze behind eating disorders, and convey the appeal of "body naturalness" from the standpoint of ecofeminism.

## Technology desciption:
Mainly using unity AR technology, participants can scan the mushroom product label and view machine learning video and medical device 3D models, and using distance detection sensor and light sensor to switch two scene videos.

#### Part1: Pre-research(June-July)
· Decide project background and the artwork direction

#### Part2: Start_Testing(July-August)
1. Organize the dataset (mushrooms)
2. Blender builds the female body
3. Complete the fusion of the female body with the mushroom
4. Display of final results
5. Design the mushroom women style

#### Part3: Technical Implementation(August- September) 
1. Start designing the scene of the video and some meaning
2. Add  character into scene 
3. Blender adds video in shader editor
4. Start designing unity AR

#### Part4: Technical Outcome(September -October) 
1. Discuss recent results with your mentor
2. Unity AR tagging
3. Test unity AR
4. Display of final results
4.1 Two-segment video
4.2 Unity AR results

#### Part5: Final Stage(October -November)
1. Packaging AR product appearance
2. Write distance sensing code as well as light bar effects
3. Discuss recent results with your mentor
4. Essay outline
5. Installation Appearance building
6. Clip videos

## The future of my work :
According to my research results and the user's feedback on the visual interactive installation, there are several principled suggestions for the improvement of this device in the future:
<br>
1. Add more introductions about my own experience. Considering that this work is more based on my own experience of eating disorders, more content can be included in the video or AR scans products in the installation in the future. Descriptive text is a good way to help visitors better understand the content of this topic
<br>
2. Considering more age groups of visitors. Through interviews’ result, it is found that nearly 35% of the visitors think that the elements of horror should be reduced, and can adjust the appropriate improvements to the sound of the installation video and the shape of the mushroom woman in the future.
<br>
3. Change and add some interaction methods. Some participants pointed out that the distance detect area is relatively small, and the sensing range and light irradiation range can be appropriately expanded, so give participants an intuitive feeling of which they could step into. At the same time, more technical equipment can be added, such as a full range of projection effects or VR equipment to replace the current display screen, allowing participants to have a more immersive audio-visual experience.
